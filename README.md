# Communication-Strategies
An organized compilation of ideas for oneself to communicate strategically. Formed and written by Onri Jay Benally.

This tree of terminologies have been helpful to me over the years in the English-speaking world, and it also contains some of the best adverbs I have found to be effective in speech and literature. Enjoy.

Communication Strategy Tree - Onri 

```
├─ Reality Alignment
│  ├─ Literally – exact portrayal
│  ├─ Faithfully – integrity-anchored depiction
│  ├─ Metaphorically – figurative framing
│  └─ In its direct or true form – unmediated, canonical phrasing
│
├─ Degree of Certainty
│  ├─ Perhaps – tentative probability
│  ├─ Arguably – defensible, yet contestable, speaker-oriented epistemic stance (hedged assertion)
│  └─ Relatively – context-bound qualification
│
├─ Extent/ Completeness
│  ├─ Virtually – almost wholly (≈ 99 %)
│  ├─ Practically – nearly, within pragmatic limits (≈ 95 %)
│  └─ Effectively – operationally equivalent in outcome (≈ 95–99 %), results-focused
│
├─ Modal/ Counterfactual Stance
│  ├─ Hypothetically – speculative scenario testing
│  ├─ Theoretically – arithmetically supported, by logic or data-pattern model
│  ├─ Suppose – assumed premise posited for exploration
│  ├─ If it were any different – counterfactual premise introduction
│  └─ On the flip side – alternative-outcome contrast
│
├─ Methodological Lens
│  ├─ Analytically – evidence-weighted derivation (systematic)
│  ├─ Systematically – step-wise, protocol-driven approach
│  ├─ Strategically – purpose-aligned planning
│  ├─ At the implementation level – code-/hardware-layer perspective
│  └─ Organically – emerging naturally from context without forced structure
│
├─ Conditionality & Contingency
│  ├─ Conditionally – valid only under stated premise(s)
│  └─ By default – baseline assumption prior to override
│
├─ Ideal-Real Spectrum
│  ├─ Ideally – perfect-world benchmark
│  ├─ Realistically thus far – evidence-based checkpoint
│  └─ Currently deployed – empirically instantiated case
│
├─ Temporal & Agency Orientation
│  └─ Proactively – forward-acting, anticipatory intervention
│
├─ Attention & Salience
│  ├─ Notably – signals noteworthy element
│  ├─ Interestingly – highlights engaging detail
│  └─ Of interest – flags relevant point
│
└─ Norms & Baselines
   └─ Conventionally – by established practice or standard usage
