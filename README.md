# Communication-Strategies
An organized compilation of ideas for oneself to communicate strategically. Formed and written by Onri Jay Benally.

This tree of terminologies have been helpful to me over the years in the English-speaking world, and it also contains some of the best adverbs I have found to be effective in speech and literature. Enjoy.

Communication Strategy Tree - by Onri 

```
├─ Reality Alignment
│  ├─ Literally – exact portrayal
│  ├─ Faithfully – integrity‑anchored depiction
│  ├─ Metaphorically – figurative framing
│  └─ In its direct or true form – unmediated, canonical phrasing
│
├─ Degree of Certainty
│  ├─ Perhaps – tentative probability
│  ├─ Arguably – defensible, yet contestable, speaker‑oriented epistemic stance (hedged assertion)
│  ├─ Relatively – context‑bound qualification
│  ├─ Reasonably – logically justified, moderately confident
│  └─ Plausibly – appears possible or credible given current knowledge
│
├─ Extent/ Completeness
│  ├─ Virtually – almost wholly (≈ 99 %)
│  ├─ Practically – nearly, within pragmatic limits (≈ 95 %)
│  └─ Effectively – operationally equivalent in outcome (≈ 95–99 %), results‑focused
│
├─ Modal/ Counterfactual Stance
│  ├─ Hypothetically – speculative scenario testing
│  ├─ Theoretically – arithmetically supported, by logic or data‑pattern model
│  ├─ Suppose – assumed premise posited for exploration
│  ├─ If it were any different – counterfactual premise introduction
│  └─ On the flip side – alternative‑outcome contrast
│
├─ Methodological Lens
│  ├─ Analytically – evidence‑weighted derivation (systematic)
│  ├─ Systematically – step‑wise, protocol‑driven approach
│  ├─ Strategically – purpose‑aligned planning
│  ├─ At the implementation level – code‑/hardware‑layer perspective
│  └─ Organically – emerging naturally from context without forced structure
│
├─ Conditionality & Contingency
│  ├─ Conditionally – valid only under stated premise(s)
│  └─ By default – baseline assumption prior to override
│
├─ Ideal‑Real Spectrum
│  ├─ Ideally – perfect‑world benchmark
│  ├─ Realistically thus far – evidence‑based checkpoint
│  └─ Currently deployed – empirically instantiated case
│
├─ Temporal & Agency Orientation
│  └─ Proactively – forward‑acting, anticipatory intervention
│
├─ Attention & Salience
│  ├─ Notably – signals noteworthy element
│  ├─ Interestingly – highlights engaging detail
│  └─ Of interest – flags relevant point
│
└─ Norms & Baselines
   └─ Conventionally – by established practice or standard usage

Functional Analogy Categories to Help Explain Virtually Anything to a General Audience - by Onri

```
└─ Root
   ├─ Analogy Families
   │  ├─ LEGO analogy
   │  ├─ Gravity analogy
   │  ├─ Basketball analogy
   │  ├─ Football/soccer analogy
   │  ├─ Mechanical analogy
   │  └─ Car-related analogies
   ├─ Abstraction & Convergence
   │  ├─ Heat map
   │  └─ “Spherical cow”
   ├─ Perception & Analysis
   │  ├─ Can be felt or seen
   │  └─ Analyzed with dots in a finite dimension
   │     └─ Often two-dimensional (2D)
   │        └─ Exception: three-dimensional (3D) chess
   └─ Communication Reminder
      └─ “Say it with your chest.”

Idea Formation Pathways - by Onri 

```
Scaffolding
│   – Pre‑formation of rudimentary tables & smaller trees
│
├─ Formation of hierarchy/ mind‑map/ pathway diagram(s)
│   └─ Decision: which simulation to run?
│       ├─ Steady‑state simulation
│       │   └─ (optional) feed results into scatter‑plot refinement
│       └─ Transient simulation (animated)
│           └─ (optional) feed results into scatter‑plot refinement
│
├─ Formation of heatmap(s)/ action‑consequence diagram(s)
│   └─ (Supplement with a gravity‑hill diagram or a mechanical analogy)
│       └─ Decision: which simulation to run if applicable?
│           ├─ Steady‑state simulation
│           │   └─ (optional) feed results into scatter‑plot refinement
│           └─ Transient simulation (animated)
│               └─ (optional) feed results into scatter‑plot refinement
│
└─ Draft scatter‑plot (based on the initial tables)
    └─ Refine scatter‑plot (incorporate data produced by any simulation or literature search)
        └─ Comprehensive scatter‑plot (final result)
